        At STAIR laboratory we often use cloud GPUs for calculations. There are a lot of offers from many providers, and to pick the right offer is a difficult choice. In order to compare cloud GPU offers by cost and performance we gathered information from cloud providers' websites and summarized it in a table and created a number of interactive charts.

        The <b>first page</b> has CPU and GPU performance graph, cost graph for varying rent period, a graph of cost per 1 TFlops<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> of CPU and GPU performance and a table with details for each offer. The <b>second page</b> contains graphs with approximate calculation time and cost for a fixed amount of CPU and GPU floating point operations (FLOPs). A few <a href="#pic1" title="See Fig.1">smaller charts</a> on the top of both pages are used for selecting (filtering) offers by provider, GPU model, number of GPUs, etc. These charts also provide statistical information like offers distribution  by providers, by numbers of GPUs and by amount of RAM.

        Nowadays, there are many options for using cloud GPUs for machine learning, but if we look back, only a year ago the situation was completely different: the cloud GPUs were still rare and was mainly used for visualization.  Following Amazon, which began offering p2 instance<a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a> for machine learning in September 2016, other providers such as Softlayer (IBM), Nimbix, MS Azure and Google offered options for machine learning in the cloud. Because the main use of cloud GPUs has shifted towards machine learning calculations, more powerful GPUs and CPUs were offered, amount of memory have been increased (there are offers with up to 1000 GB), SSDs have become the main option for storage.
    </p>

    <p>
        Microsoft Azure cloud's first GPU offer, namely N series, was announced in August 2016, but it was in December of the same year that it actually became available to the public. Although the N series of Azure Cloud is not conspicuous both in terms of performance and cost compared with other providers' offers, it has an advantage that you can use Azure Machine Learning Studio, a machine learning framework developed by Microsoft.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although Google was the last of the major cloud providers in the United States that started offering GPU instances, it's distinctive feature is that it is possible to finely set the specifications of an instance. Looking at the types of GPUs, Microsoft's NV series offers NVIDIA M60, and Amazon, Microsoft and Google provide NVIDIA K80<a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the same year of 2016 a Japanese cloud provider Sakura Internet began offering GPU servers.
        Monthly fee is much cheaper than offers with similar performance from other providers. Especially "Quad GPU model" server with 4 NVIDIA Titan X-s is attractive in terms of cost-performance. However, the initial cost apply, so if you plan to use it for a short period of time, other companies' offer will be advantageous.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another provider with high cost-performance ratio is LeaderTelecom from the Netherlands. It offers instances with 8 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs with very high performance. CPU performance is also very good, but the amount of memory is comparatively small: up to 128 GB. Cirrascale is a provider that offers instances with even higher GPU performance than LeaderTelecom. Cirrascale offers instances with 8 NVIDIA P40 and with 8 NVIDIA Quadro P6000 GPUs. It is the highest GPU performance available in the cloud.
    </p>

    <p>
        Though not a general cloud provider, the University of Tokyo provides GPU-equipped supercomputer Reedbush-H not only to educational institutions, but also to general private companies and individuals for particular tasks that passed a peer review. GPU performance is not conspicuous, but CPU performance and interconnect are of the highest standards. The price is cheap, so if you are able to pass a peer review, you can use the best cost-performance cloud GPU offer. However, it is worth noting that you will probably not be able to install a new software, because supercomputers have the same software environment on all nodes, and users are not granted root permissions. Another important point to note is that for a one-year plan available node time is limited. If you run jobs that span multiple nodes for a long time, you may run out of node time in a few months, and continued usage will incur additional charges. For details, please read the remarks on <a href="http://www.cc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/support/application/kitei/hyou5.pdf" title="in Japanese only" target="_blank">the University of Tokyo website</a> (if you are fluent in Japanese).
    </p>

    <p>
        Let us actually compare some offers using the interactive charts.     In order to compare offers we need to consider a lot of factors: GPU and CPU models, amount of memory and hard disk volume, interconnect and Internet bandwidth to name a few. The price is also an important factor. However, different offers charged by different time units. There are offers that charged per minute and there are yearly charged plans. Some require initial costs and some plans limit available node time, so even cost comparison is not easy.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to compare the performance of instances, let's first compare GPU and CPU performance which have a big influence on performance.  On <a href="http://comp.photo777.org/cloud-gpu-providers-comparison/" target="_blank">Cloud GPU providers comparison</a>  page there is a graph for comparing GPU and CPU performance. For example, if you want to see comparison results between Sakura Internet and Amazon offers, use a small filtering graph at the top of the page to filter offers displayed on all graphs. The filtering is done by clicking "Amazon" and "Sakura" on the Provider chart. The following figure (Fig.1) shows filtering charts with offers filtered by providers.
    </p>

    <figure id="pic1">

        <img src="https://stair.center/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/filtergraphs.png" alt="" width="682" height="310" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-462"/>

        <figcaption>Fig.1. Filtering charts in the state of filtering offers by provider (Amazon and Sakura). Other charts display information only for the filtered offers.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        After we filtered offers and only Amazon and Sakura Internet offers are displayed, let's compare them using the CPU and GPU performance graph.
    </p>
    <figure id="pic2">
        <img src="https://stair.center/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cpu_gpu_performance.png" alt="" width="682" height="332" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-461"/>

        <figcaption>Fig.2. GPU and CPU performance graph comparing Amazon p2.8xlarge offer with a close by CPU and GPU performance Quad GPU model offer from Sakura Internet.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Amazon's p2.8xlarge offer and Sakura Internet's Quad GPU model offer are close by CPU and GPU performance, but which is cheaper? Sakura Internet offer is charged monthly and has an initial cost. On the other hand, the offer from Amazon is charged by hours and there is no initial cost. Looking at the cost graph below you can see that if you plan to use for more than two months Sakura Internet offer<a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a> would be cheaper.
    </p>

    <figure id="pic3">
        <img src="https://stair.center/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/time_cost-1.png" alt="" width="682" height="408" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-588" />

        <figcaption>Fig.3. The cost graph with period of use on the x-axis. Comparison of Amazon's p2.8xlarge offer and Sakura Internet's Quad GPU model offer. For more than two months Sakura Internet offer will be cheaper.</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>
        In such cases of comparing offers with close performance parameters you can see, which one is better if you compare costs. To compare offers that are far-off on performance graph you can use cost per 1 TFlops<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Cost per TFlops parameter changes depending on the usage period, if you change the usage period on the cost graph on fig.3, cost per 1 TFlops will also change. You can change usage period by clicking on the cost graph.
    </p>


    <figure id="pic4">
        <img src="https://stair.center/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1tflops_cost.png" alt="" width="683" height="377" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-460" />

        <figcaption>Fig.4. Comparison of Amazon and Sakura Internet offers by cost per 1 TFlops for two months use period.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Comparing Amazon and Sakura Internet offers for two months use you can see, that Sakura's TitanX x4 instance (which is the familiar "Quad GPU model") is the cheapest by GPU TFlops cost and Amazon's p2 dedicated instance with 1 year contract is the cheapest by CPU TFlops cost. For a longer use periods TitanX x4 will be the cheapest even at the cost of CPU performance, and GPU performance will be several times cheaper than the Amazon's offer.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can see, that if the period of use is fixed, you can compare offers by the cost per 1 TFlops. But what if you do not know the use period and what you have is a task that you need to calculate? If calculation is done quickly you do not need to use the cloud for a long time. If the amount of calculation is fixed, you can compare offers by the time and the cost needed to complete the calculation task. The higher the performance, the shorter the computation time becomes, and the less expensive it is, so even if the price is somewhat high, an instance with higher performance should be advantageous. Let's compare the same two offers from Amazon and Sakura Internet using <a href="http://comp.photo777.org/cloud-gpu-providers-more-graphs/" target="_blank">Calculation Time and Cost graph</a>.
    </p>


    <figure id="pic5">
        <img src="https://stair.center/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GPU_cost_time.png" alt="" width="682" height="465" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-463" />

        <figcaption>Fig.5. Graph of cost and time for a fixed amount of GPU calculations in floating point operations. Offers closer to the lower left corner are more advantageous.</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>
        Let's compare offers by calculation cost and time while changing the calculation amount for GPUs. Sakura Internet and Amazon offers are in close contact as the calculation volume rises to 200 EFLOPs. The further the amount of computation increases, the more Sakura's offer will be advantageous. In case of CPU calculations, Sakura will overtake Amazon at around 50 EFLOPs. You can see that Sakura Internet is more advantageous for tasks with larger computational complexity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, we would like you to keep in mind, while using the aforementioned graphs, that there are lots of other factors that affect computation time besides CPU and GPU performance, and floating point operations (FLOPs) we were using for comparison in this review is only one of indicating parameters.

        <sup id="note2">2</sup> In cloud computing, a virtual machine to be lent is called an instance. In this article, however, we sometimes compare virtual machines and bare metal servers, calling them all "instances" for convenience.

        <sup id="note3">3</sup> Amazon, Microsoft and Google provide instances with NVIDIA K80-s, but you need to pay attention to the number of GPUs displayed on provider's website. There are two Tesla GK 210 GPUs on one K80 card, and the numbers on provider's websites are the numbers of GK 210-s; the number of cards is half of that.

        <sup id="note4">4</sup> I picked up a monthly charged offer from Sakura Internet in this article, but Sakura Internet also has <a href="https://www.sakura.ad.jp/koukaryoku/specification/" target="_blank">hourly charged offers</a> and <a href="https://www.sakura.ad.jp/education/solution/cloud-teigaku.html?=mail_20170424" target="_blank">annual contract offers</a>.
